## 🎯 Product Management Approach: AI-First Development

### The 7-Day Full-Stack Challenge
As a Product Manager with no prior solo full-stack development experience, I set out to prove AI could genuinely compress learning curves. The result: **Trailhead**, a sophisticated IFS therapy companion built in 7 days with:

- **2,500+ lines of TypeScript** across frontend and backend
- **30+ AI agent tools** implementing therapeutic methodology
- **Domain-specific memory system** with differential snapshot architecture
- **Production-ready features** including authentication, real-time chat, and data visualization

### The CAST Framework for AI Development
Through painful trial and error, I developed a systematic approach that actually works:

#### **C**larify: Define Exactly What You Want
- Not "build me a dashboard" but "dashboard showing user's 5 most recent conversations, with archive/delete actions, displaying first message truncated to 50 characters"
- Partner with AI to refine requirements through iterative questioning

#### **A**rchitect: Make Foundational Decisions  
- Database schema design, security boundaries, naming conventions require human judgment
- AI implements any approach perfectly, but architectural decisions need domain expertise
- Use AI to propose options and explain trade-offs, then choose based on long-term implications

#### **S**caffold: Build Minimal Skeleton Files
- Establish patterns AI can follow rather than one-shotting complete features
- Create first components showing loading states, errors, props, imports
- Incrementally extend established patterns for architectural coherence

#### **T**est: Let AI Define "Correct" 
- Never write tests myself, but instruct agents to test each request before committing
- Tests become communication with AI, defining correctness in your specific context

### Strategic AI Tool Orchestra
No single tool handles every cognitive task. I assembled a specialized toolkit:

#### **Complex + Precision: GPT-5-Thinking-High in Warp**
- **When**: High-consequence changes where mistakes are expensive
- **Example**: Built complete user memory system with differential state management, JSON Patch algorithms, and secured cron automation - 470 lines across 9 files, one-shot implementation
- **Speed**: Slow (several minutes) but surgical reliability
#### **Fast Agentic Exploration: Claude Code**  
- **When**: Real-time problem-solving and codebase exploration
- **Killer Feature**: Spawning sub-agents for parallel tasks with specific POVs
- **Example**: Simultaneous codebase exploration and pattern searches, synthesized results

#### **Brute Force Context: Gemini CLI**
- **When**: Whole-codebase analysis, architectural trade-offs
- **Advantage**: Massive context windows + built-in Google search
- **Example**: Input entire codebase, ramble about problems, paste lengthy error logs conversationally

#### **Frontend + Async: Jules**
- **When**: UI skeletons, interactive planning, simple refactors
- **Workflow**: 10 minutes detailed specs → commit to branch → working PR 10 minutes later
- **Strength**: Interactive planning with asynchronous implementation in separate VMs

#### **Voice Input: Wispr Flow**
- **When**: Any complex explanation or requirement gathering  
- **Advantage**: 109 WPM transcription captures thinking process, not just commands
- **Impact**: Voice provides context and uncertainty that helps AI explore approaches

## 📊 The Human-AI Division of Labor

### What You Cannot Delegate
Hard-learned lesson: **You cannot prompt what you cannot explain logically**. Critical non-delegable decisions:

#### **Architectural Foundations**
- **Database schema design** - Every wrong choice cascades through your entire application
- **Security boundaries** - Row Level Security, authentication flows, data access patterns
- **Domain logic** - How IFS therapy concepts map to data structures and user workflows
- **Integration decisions** - Which services connect and how they handle failure states

#### **The Gray Zone: Collaborative Magic**
Where domain expertise meets AI implementation skills. Example: **Parts Garden Feature**

**My Constraints**: Parts as nodes, relationships as edges, visual weight based on evidence strength, emotional charge through color/size, drag-and-drop with stable positioning

**AI's Implementation**: 500+ lines of sophisticated React with D3.js integration - force-directed graph with physics simulation, self-organizing parts based on relationships, smooth animations reflecting emotional charge, dynamic clustering

**The Result**: Code I couldn't have written in six months, implementing a vision I couldn't have technically specified.

### Why Starting From Scratch Fails
**The Anti-Pattern**: Requesting complete features from scratch creates disconnected code feeling like different developers worked from subtly different specifications.

**The Breakthrough**: AI should follow foundational decisions, not make them.

#### **Incremental Expansion Strategy**
1. **Build One Domain First**: Started with chat agent as solid foundation
2. **Expand Adjacent Areas**: From chat → user memory → parts visualization → relationship mapping  
3. **Establish Patterns**: Let AI extend and refine rather than create from nothing
4. **Maintain Coherence**: Every generated line feels architecturally consistent

### Planning Revolutionizes Everything
**Key Insight**: Have AI explain what it's building before asking it to execute.

This planning step:
- Defines "correctness" within your specific context
- Becomes specification language AI understands and optimizes toward  
- Eliminates dead-end execution that plagued other approaches
- Prevents "fake implementations" when AI gets overwhelmed

**Workflow**: Rubber duck with GPT-5-Thinking-High first → let it crawl codebase and develop approach → execute that plan with appropriate tool

## Ethereal Theme (global)

The ethereal visual style is controlled centrally via ThemeController and CSS variables.

- Enable globally: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_IFS_ETHEREAL_THEME=true` (default is enabled when unset)
- Switch standard `/chat` to ethereal presentation: `NEXT_PUBLIC_IFS_ETHEREAL_CHAT=true` (we default to ethereal unless explicitly disabled)
- Dev override (no redeploy):
  ```js
  // In browser console
  localStorage.setItem('eth-theme', JSON.stringify({ enabled: 1 })) // or 0 to hide backdrop
  // Change background image (must exist in /public)
  localStorage.setItem('eth-theme', JSON.stringify({ imageUrl: '/ethereal-bg.jpg' }))
  location.reload()
  ```
- Central tokens live in `config/etherealTheme.ts`:
  - Background image URL, vignette levels, blob colors/positions
  - Text opacities and letter spacing (assistant/user)
  - Animation timings (word/char fade, streaming cadence)
- Components consume CSS variables; avoid hardcoding visuals in components. See `warp.md` for rules and a PR checklist.

## 🏆 The Real Revolution

This isn't about AI making coding magical. **AI makes domain expertise programmable.**

Six months ago, my understanding of Internal Family Systems therapy remained locked in my mind. Today, it exists as functioning software with:

- **Real users** creating accounts and mapping their internal parts
- **Therapeutic conversations** with AI agents that remember psychological context across sessions  
- **Data visualization** helping people understand their internal systems over time
- **Production architecture** ready for healthcare compliance and scale

**The Paradigm Shift**: If you deeply understand a problem domain, AI can now transform that understanding directly into working software. The bottleneck shifts from technical implementation to clarity of vision.

**For Product Managers**: This changes everything. Your domain expertise and user empathy become your competitive advantage in an AI-accelerated world. Technical implementation becomes a commodity; strategic thinking and user understanding become exponentially more valuable.

*This repository demonstrates that the future of product management isn't about learning to code - it's about learning to think clearly enough that AI can code for you.*
