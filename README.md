- **2,500+ lines of TypeScript** across frontend and backend
- **30+ AI agent tools** implementing IFS therapeutic methodology
- **Domain-specific memory system** with differential snapshot architecture
- **Production-ready features** including authentication, real-time chat, and data visualization

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, shadcn/ui + Radix UI
- **Backend**: Supabase with PostgreSQL, Row Level Security, real-time subscriptions  
- **AI Integration**: Mastra Agent Framework + OpenRouter for multi-model inference
- **Visualization**: D3.js force-directed graphs for Parts Garden feature
- **Deployment**: Vercel with environment-based configuration

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Approach

### The CAST Development Framework
Building complex applications with AI requires systematic approaches:

#### **C**larify: Precise Requirements
- Specific feature definitions: "dashboard showing user's 5 most recent conversations, with archive/delete actions, displaying first message truncated to 50 characters"
- Iterative refinement through AI collaboration to surface edge cases and clarify intent

#### **A**rchitect: Foundation-First Design  
- Database schema, security boundaries, and naming conventions established before implementation
- AI proposes architectural options with trade-off analysis for informed decision-making
- Domain expertise guides long-term structural decisions

#### **S**caffold: Pattern Establishment
- Minimal skeleton components demonstrating loading states, error handling, and data flow
- Consistent patterns that AI can extend rather than one-shotting disconnected features
- Architectural coherence through incremental expansion

#### **T**est: Automated Validation
- AI-generated tests that define correctness within the application's specific context
- Continuous validation during development to catch regressions early

### AI Development Toolkit
Multiple specialized AI tools were used for different aspects of development:

#### **Complex + Precision: GPT-5-Thinking-High in Warp**
- **When**: High-consequence changes where mistakes are expensive
- **Example**: Built complete user memory system with differential state management, JSON Patch algorithms, and secured cron automation - 470 lines across 9 files, one-shot implementation
- **Speed**: Slow (several minutes) but surgical reliability

#### **Fast Agentic Exploration: Claude Code**  
- **When**: Real-time problem-solving and codebase exploration
- **Killer Feature**: Spawning sub-agents for parallel tasks with specific POVs
- **Example**: Simultaneous codebase exploration and pattern searches, synthesized results

#### **Brute Force Context: Gemini CLI**
- **When**: Whole-codebase analysis, architectural trade-offs
- **Advantage**: Massive context windows + built-in Google search
- **Example**: Input entire codebase, ramble about problems, paste lengthy error logs conversationally

#### **Frontend + Async: Jules**
- **When**: UI skeletons, interactive planning, simple refactors
- **Workflow**: 10 minutes detailed specs ‚Üí commit to branch ‚Üí working PR 10 minutes later
- **Strength**: Interactive planning with asynchronous implementation in separate VMs

#### **Voice Input: Wispr Flow**
- **When**: Any complex explanation or requirement gathering  
- **Advantage**: 109 WPM transcription captures thinking process, not just commands
- **Impact**: Voice provides context and uncertainty that helps AI explore approaches

## üéØ Key Development Insights

### Critical Decision Points
Building Trailhead revealed important boundaries in AI-assisted development:

#### **Architectural Foundations**
- **Database schema design** - Every wrong choice cascades through your entire application
- **Security boundaries** - Row Level Security, authentication flows, data access patterns
- **Domain logic** - How IFS therapy concepts map to data structures and user workflows
- **Integration decisions** - Which services connect and how they handle failure states

#### **Collaborative Implementation: Parts Garden**
The most complex feature emerged from combining domain knowledge with AI implementation:

**Requirements**: Visual representation of internal "parts" as nodes with relationship edges, emotional charge expressed through color/size, drag-and-drop interaction with physics-based positioning

**AI Implementation**: 500+ lines of React with D3.js integration featuring force-directed graph physics, self-organizing node clustering, smooth animations reflecting emotional states, and dynamic relationship visualization

**Outcome**: Production-ready data visualization that transforms abstract psychological concepts into intuitive, interactive interfaces

### Incremental Development Strategy
Building complex features requires careful sequencing:

#### **Foundation-First Approach**
1. **Establish Core Domain**: Chat agent implementation as the architectural foundation
2. **Adjacent Expansion**: User memory ‚Üí parts visualization ‚Üí relationship mapping
3. **Pattern Consistency**: AI extends established patterns rather than creating from scratch
4. **Architectural Coherence**: Maintains consistency across all generated code

### Planning-First Implementation
Critical workflow discovery: AI explanation before execution prevents failed implementations.

**Process**: Detailed planning phase using GPT-5-Thinking-High for codebase analysis and approach development, followed by execution with the appropriate specialized tool

**Benefits**:
- Defines correctness within the application's specific context
- Creates specification language AI can optimize toward
- Eliminates dead-end implementations and "fake" placeholder code
- Ensures architectural consistency across features
