## ðŸš€ NEXT PHASES (Remaining Tasks)

### Phase 1: Feature Flags & Core Infrastructure
**Priority: HIGH** - Required to gate rollout and enable development

#### 1.1 Feature Flags System
- [ ] Add flags to existing feature flag system:
  - `onboarding_v1` (master flag)
  - `onboarding_redirect` (routes new users after OAuth)
  - `intervention_cards` (to gate new InterventionCard system)
- [ ] Default: off in production, on in staging; allow per-user overrides
- [ ] Add typed helpers: `lib/flags/index.ts: getFlag(name, userId?), getVariant(name, userId?)`
- [ ] Gate all onboarding routes, UI mounts, and middleware-based redirects behind flags

### Phase 2: Auth Integration & Routing
**Priority: HIGH** - Required for user flow

#### 2.1 Auth-aware Middleware
- [ ] Update middleware.ts with feature flag gating:
  - If `onboarding_redirect` is on, user is authenticated, and `user_onboarding.status != 'completed'`, redirect to `/onboarding`
- [ ] Use Supabase middleware client to read session and lightweight select of user_onboarding by user_id
- [ ] Ensure not to redirect asset/API routes; allow `/api/onboarding/*`, `/onboarding`, `/auth/*`
- [ ] On OAuth callback flow, set final redirect to `/onboarding` or `/today` based on completion

### Phase 3: Core UI Components
**Priority: HIGH** - The user-facing experience

#### 3.1 Onboarding Wizard Foundation
- [ ] Route: `app/onboarding/page.tsx`
- [ ] Components (shadcn/ui):
  - Card-based wizard: Card, Progress, Button, Separator, Badge, RadioGroup, Checkbox, Textarea, Skeleton
  - `OnboardingWizard` (client): orchestrates stages, renders QuestionCard(s), handles autosave
  - `QuestionCard`: renders per question type + helper text; accepts value and onChange
  - `WizardFooter`: Next/Back/Save & exit; shows autosave state; disable Next until required responses present
- [ ] Visual tone: soft copy, invitational language, brief helpers
- [ ] Keyboard and screen-reader friendly (labels, aria-describedby, focus management)

#### 3.2 Stage 1 UI (5 Fixed Probes)
- [ ] Fetch Stage 1 via GET /api/onboarding/questions?stage=1
- [ ] Render 5 single_choice questions with radio groups (updated from original likert5 design)
- [ ] On change:
  - Debounced (500ms) POST /api/onboarding/progress for each answer
  - Optimistic update to local state and progress indicator
- [ ] After all 5 are answered:
  - Request Stage 2 selection via GET /api/onboarding/questions?stage=2
  - Advance CTA: "Continue (4 quick context questions)"
- [ ] Analytics events: stage_viewed, question_answered, stage_completed

#### 3.3 Stage 2 UI (4 Adaptive Contextual Questions)
- [ ] Fetch selected 4 Stage 2 questions from server
- [ ] Lock the set in user_onboarding.stage2_selected_questions for consistency
- [ ] Render one question per card with Next/Back; allow skipping back to edit
- [ ] Autosave each response via /api/onboarding/progress
- [ ] Copy emphasizes curiosity and gentle noticing
- [ ] Brief explanations of why questions were selected (optional info tooltip)
- [ ] Analytics: stage_viewed, question_shown, question_answered, stage_completed

#### 3.4 Stage 3 UI (4 Fixed Somatic & Belief Mapping)
- [ ] Fetch or render fixed Stage 3 questions
- [ ] Use multi-select for body map and protection intents
- [ ] Free-text for beliefs and supportive message
- [ ] Autosave responses
- [ ] Completion button: "Finish and go to Today"
- [ ] Analytics: stage_viewed, question_answered, complete_clicked

#### 3.5 Autosave & Resumability
- [ ] Autosave every change with debouncing; show "Saved" state with last_saved_at time
- [ ] Persist in localStorage as fallback (keyed by userId + feature_version)
- [ ] Resume logic on page load: GET current user_onboarding, drive UI to saved stage and prefill answers

### Phase 4: Today Screen Integration
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Completes user journey

#### 4.1 Reusable InterventionCard Component
- [ ] `components/InterventionCard.tsx`:
  - Props: id, title, subtitle, icon?, tone, severity, priority, canSupersedeCheckins, actions, onDismiss, trackingId
  - Built from shadcn/ui Card primitives with slots for media and actions
  - Emits analytics: intervention_viewed, intervention_action_clicked, intervention_dismissed
  - Accessible: role="region", aria-labelledby

#### 4.2 Today Screen Integration
- [ ] Hook: `lib/today/useInterventions.ts` or server function `getTodayInterventions(userId)`
- [ ] If onboarding not completed and onboarding_v1 enabled, return InterventionCard model:
  - id: 'onboarding_prompt'
  - title: "Welcomeâ€”let's get to know your system"
  - subtitle: "A short, kind check-in to tailor your support"  
  - canSupersedeCheckins: true
  - actions: [{label:'Begin', href:'/onboarding'}]
  - priority: high
- [ ] `app/today/page.tsx`: if any card has canSupersedeCheckins = true, hide standard check-in container
- [ ] After completion: show reflective InterventionCard for 1â€“2 days with supportive message from S3_Q4

### Phase 5: User Memory & Analytics
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Enhances AI personalization

#### 5.1 User Memory Synthesis
- [ ] Server function `lib/memory/synthesizeOnboarding.ts`:
  - Inputs: userId; reads responses + derived stage1_scores
  - Deterministic synthesis into 3â€“5 concise memory entries:
    - onboarding:v1:themes â€” top 2â€“3 themes with normalized scores
    - onboarding:v1:somatic â€” selected body areas  
    - onboarding:v1:protections â€” selected "protecting from" intents
    - onboarding:v1:beliefs â€” brief free-text belief summary (S3_Q2)
    - onboarding:v1:self_compassion â€” their supportive message (S3_Q4)
  - Upsert into existing user memory system
  - Use tags for future retrieval: ['onboarding','ifs','v1']
  - Fire from POST /api/onboarding/complete and idempotently callable

#### 5.2 Analytics Implementation  
- [ ] Add `lib/analytics` with client and server wrappers
- [ ] Event catalog:
  - onboarding_started, onboarding_stage_viewed, onboarding_question_shown
  - onboarding_question_answered, onboarding_stage_completed, onboarding_progress_saved
  - onboarding_completed, intervention_viewed/action_clicked/dismissed
- [ ] Respect PII: avoid raw free-text in events; send lengths/hashes only for S3 free-text
- [ ] Add basic funnels and dashboards for completion rates and drop-off points

### Phase 6: Security & Performance
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Production readiness

#### 6.1 Security Hardening
- [ ] Input validation with zod on all API payloads (âœ… already implemented)
- [ ] Rate limit progress endpoints (20 req/min/user) and size limit payloads
- [ ] Ensure RLS is enforced by using user session with Supabase server client (âœ… implemented)
- [ ] Index checks: confirm query plans on onboarding_responses and onboarding_questions

### Phase 7: Testing & Quality
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Confidence and maintainability

#### 7.1 Unit Tests
- [ ] `scoring.test.ts`: theme mapping edge cases; normalization; tie-breaking
- [ ] `selector.test.ts`: diverse coverage of themes; deterministic selection with seed; constraints enforced  
- [ ] API route tests with supertest or Next test utils:
  - progress upsert, version conflict, completion validation

#### 7.2 E2E Tests
- [ ] Playwright scenarios:
  - New user â†’ redirect to /onboarding â†’ complete Stage 1 â†’ dynamic Stage 2 â†’ Stage 3 â†’ complete â†’ redirect to /today
  - Resume mid-way (reload) resumes correct stage and answers
  - Today screen shows InterventionCard superseding check-ins pre-completion
- [ ] Use playwright MCP to run and fix front-end issues

#### 7.3 Accessibility & Copy
- [ ] IFS-aligned copy pass:
  - Welcoming, curious, non-pathologizing; "parts" language gently introduced
  - Avoid jargon; short helper text with optional info popovers
- [ ] A11y audit:
  - Proper labels, aria attributes, focus ring and focus management per step
  - Sufficient color contrast; supports keyboard only
- [ ] Localization-ready text keys (even if only en now)

### Phase 8: Verification & Integration
**Priority: LOW** - Final validation

#### 8.1 Flow Verification
- [ ] Ensure Google OAuth callback leads to:
  - If onboarding_v1 + onboarding_redirect: /onboarding (if not completed)
  - Else: /today
- [ ] Integration test confirming no route loops and /chat is not used post-onboarding

#### 8.2 Today Feed Testing
- [ ] Unit test `getTodayInterventions` to confirm supersede behavior and priority sorting
- [ ] Analytics assertions that intervention_viewed fires on mount
- [ ] Ensure check-ins rendering is hidden only when canSupersedeCheckins=true and card is active

### Phase 9: Documentation & Rollout
**Priority: LOW** - Knowledge transfer and deployment

#### 9.1 Documentation
- [ ] `docs/onboarding.md`:
  - Architecture overview, flows, endpoints, scoring details, RLS policies, flags
  - Data dictionary: tables/columns, indexes, and retention
  - How to add questions guide
- [ ] ADR: decision on server-side selection vs DB function; rationale and tradeoffs
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG with features and flags

#### 9.2 Rollout Plan
- [ ] Stage rollout via flags:
  - 0% prod (internal QA in staging)
  - 5% prod â†’ 25% â†’ 100%, watching dashboards
- [ ] SLOs:
  - Progress save p95 < 200ms
  - Completion rate target: > 70%
- [ ] Alerts: anomaly on drop-off between Stage 1 and 2, API error rate >= 1%

#### 9.3 Production Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to staging; enable onboarding_v1 + onboarding_redirect + intervention_cards
- [ ] Manual QA with multiple accounts:
  - Redirect correctness, RLS access (no cross-user leakage)
  - Autosave/resume, Analytics events firing, Today screen supersede behavior
- [ ] Gradual prod rollout via flags; monitor dashboards; rollback by flipping flag if issues
