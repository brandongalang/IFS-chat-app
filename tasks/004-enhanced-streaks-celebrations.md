# Task 004: Enhanced Streaks & Celebrations

**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Estimated Impact**: Proven retention mechanic, builds habit
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

## Overview

Enhance existing streak tracking with milestones, celebrations, and recovery mechanics.

## Problem Statement

- Current streaks are basic (just a number)
- No celebration of milestones
- No recovery mechanism for broken streaks
- Missing "perfect week" recognition

## Proposed Solution

Add streak milestones, visual celebrations, and smart recovery options.

## Key Features

### 1. Milestone Celebrations

- 7 days: "Week Warrior" 🗓️
- 30 days: "Monthly Master" 📅
- 100 days: "Century Club" 💯
- Visual confetti/animation on achievement

### 2. Perfect Week Badges

- Track weekly completion separate from streak
- "Perfect Week" badge for 7/7 days
- Collect badges over time

### 3. Streak Recovery

- "Grace day" once per month
- "Save your streak" within 24 hours
- Partial credit for check-ins

### 4. Visual Enhancement

```text
Current: "🔥 7-day streak"
Enhanced: "🔥 7-day streak (Personal Best! 🎉)"
          "⚡ 2 days from Perfect Week!"
```

## Implementation Sketch

```typescript
// Enhanced streak data
interface StreakData {
  current: number;
  personalBest: number;
  totalDays: number;
  perfectWeeks: number;
  lastGraceDay?: Date;
  milestones: Milestone[];
}

// Milestone check
function checkMilestones(streak: number) {
  const milestones = [7, 14, 21, 30, 50, 100];
  return milestones.filter((m) => m === streak);
}
```

## Success Metrics

- Streak recovery usage
- Average streak length increase
- Perfect week completion rate
- User retention at milestone points

## Open Questions

- How many grace days to allow?
- Should streaks affect features?
- Public vs private achievements?

## Next Steps

1. Design milestone UI/animations
2. Implement grace day logic
3. Create celebration components
4. Add analytics tracking
