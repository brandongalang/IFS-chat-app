# Frontend Inbox Implementation

## Summary
- Replaced the Today page meditation card with `InboxShelf`, a reusable surface in `components/inbox/` backed by `useInboxFeed`.
- Added inbox typing contracts (`types/inbox.ts`), analytics stubs, and normalization utilities for resilient rendering.
- Implemented modal detail view for insight spotlight cards with accessibility and Tailwind-consistent styling.

## Open Questions
- Do we promote multiple inbox cards at once on the Today page grid, or keep a single spotlight for MVP?
- Should `useInboxFeed` expose pagination metadata now or defer until additional card types exist?

## Verification
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm test`
- Visual spot-check recommended once dev server is available.
