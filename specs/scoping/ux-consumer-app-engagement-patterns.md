## The Core Tension

You're caught between two models:

**Therapy Model** (Deep, Slow)

- Weekly sessions
- Deep exploration
- Professional guidance
- Slow transformation

**Consumer App Model** (Quick, Daily)

- Daily micro-interactions
- Quick dopamine hits
- Social/gamified
- Habit formation

## The Hybrid Solution: "Daily Depth"

Combine both models:

### Morning (2 min) - Consumer App Mode

- Quick check-in
- See daily insight
- Update streak
- Set micro-intention

### Anytime (5-20 min) - Therapy Mode

- Deep chat when ready
- Explore patterns
- Work with parts
- Real processing

### Evening (2 min) - Consumer App Mode

- Quick reflection
- Log the day
- See progress
- Maintain streak

This gives you:

- ‚úÖ Daily touchpoints for retention
- ‚úÖ Depth when users have time
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking for motivation
- ‚úÖ Flexibility for different days

The key is making the **shallow interactions valuable** (not just check-boxes) while keeping the **deep work accessible** (not intimidating).
