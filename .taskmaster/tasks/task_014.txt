# Task ID: 14
# Title: Build Chat UI: ChatInput and Layout
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main chat layout, including the multi-line text input for users to send messages.
# Details:
Develop the `ChatInput` component as a multi-line textarea that auto-resizes. Implement 'Send on Enter' and 'Shift+Enter for new line' functionality. The input should be disabled while the assistant is generating a response. Assemble the main chat page layout.

# Test Strategy:
Use React Testing Library to test the input's behavior, such as state changes, submission logic, and disabled state. Manually test usability and responsiveness across different screen sizes.
