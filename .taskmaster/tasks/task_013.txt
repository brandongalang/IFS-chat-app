# Task ID: 13
# Title: Build Chat UI: MessageList Component
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the React component to display the conversation history, supporting streaming text and tool usage indicators.
# Details:
Create a `MessageList` component that renders an array of messages. It must handle streaming text updates for the last message. When a message contains `toolCalls`, it should render a visual indicator like '[üîç Searching for patterns...]'. Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

# Test Strategy:
Use Storybook to develop the component in isolation with various message types (user, assistant, streaming, with tools). Use React Testing Library to verify correct rendering based on props.
