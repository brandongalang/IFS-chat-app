# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Project Infrastructure & Authentication
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the foundational project structure, including the Next.js application, Supabase database, and user authentication flow.
# Details:
Initialize a Next.js 14 App Router project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Configure a new Supabase project, setting up environment variables (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY). Implement the user sign-up and sign-in flow using Supabase Auth, including JWT handling and session management on the client-side.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test auth utility functions. Manually test the sign-up, login, and logout user flows. Verify that JWTs are correctly created and stored.
