# Task ID: 20
# Title: Final MVP Polish and Documentation
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: low
# Description: Perform final UI/UX polishing, add loading states, and create essential developer documentation.
# Details:
Review the entire application for UI consistency and minor bugs. Add loading states (e.g., breathing animations) for data fetching and message generation to improve perceived performance. Create a README.md with setup instructions, environment variable definitions, and an overview of the architecture.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct a full user acceptance testing (UAT) session with internal stakeholders to gather feedback. Review the documentation to ensure a new developer could set up and run the project successfully.
