# Task ID: 16
# Title: Integrate Frontend Components with Backend API
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 14, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Connect the chat UI components to the backend API endpoints, manage client-side state, and handle data flow.
# Details:
Use a state management library like Zustand to manage the application state (messages, parts list, session status). Wire the `ChatInput` to the `/api/chat` endpoint to send messages. Consume the SSE stream to update the `MessageList` in real-time. Fetch initial data for the `PartsSidebar`.

# Test Strategy:
Write end-to-end tests using Playwright that simulate a user logging in, sending a message, and seeing the response appear. Verify that the state in Zustand is updated correctly throughout the process.
