# Task ID: 3
# Title: Set Up Logging, Monitoring, and Error Tracking
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate services for observability, including structured logging, performance monitoring, and error tracking.
# Details:
Integrate Sentry for real-time error tracking on both the frontend and backend. Configure structured logging for API routes and background jobs to provide context for debugging. Integrate PostHog or a similar analytics tool to track key user success metrics like session length and part emergence.

# Test Strategy:
Intentionally trigger a client-side and a server-side error and verify they appear in Sentry with correct stack traces. Perform an action that should be tracked and confirm the event appears in PostHog.
