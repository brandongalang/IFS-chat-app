# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Evidence and Pattern Management Tools
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 2, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the `logEvidence` and `findPatterns` tools, which are central to the evidence-based emergence feature.
# Details:
Implement the `logEvidence` function to add evidence to a part's `recentEvidence` array, enforcing the limit of 10. Implement `findPatterns` to analyze conversation history from the `Sessions` table, looking for recurring themes and suggesting potential new parts based on frequency and recency. These tools will extend the chat API to enable pattern recognition during conversations.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test `logEvidence` to ensure it correctly caps the evidence array. For `findPatterns`, create test data with known patterns in session messages and verify the tool correctly identifies them with appropriate confidence scores. Test integration with the chat API.
