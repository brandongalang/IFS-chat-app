# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the chat interface is fully responsive for mobile and tablet devices and meets basic accessibility standards.
# Details:
Use Tailwind CSS's responsive design utilities to adapt the layout for smaller screens. Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable and have appropriate ARIA labels. Test color contrast to meet WCAG AA standards. The primary focus is on the chat view and parts sidebar.

# Test Strategy:
Manually test the application on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, using their respective developer tools for mobile emulation. Use an automated accessibility checker like Axe to identify and fix common issues. Perform keyboard-only navigation tests.
