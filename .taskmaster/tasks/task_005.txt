# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Part Discovery & Management Tools
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 2, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the agent tools for finding, creating, and updating parts: `searchParts`, `getPartById`, `createEmergingPart`, `updatePart`.
# Details:
Develop the server-side functions for these tools. `createEmergingPart` must enforce the 3+ evidence rule and user confirmation flow. `updatePart` must correctly increment confidence and maintain an audit trail (e.g., in a JSONB field). `searchParts` should efficiently query the `Parts` table. These tools will be integrated into the chat API to give the IFS agent part management capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test each tool's logic, especially the business rules for `createEmergingPart` and `updatePart`. Test the `searchParts` tool with various queries and filters to ensure correctness and performance. Verify integration with the chat API endpoint.
