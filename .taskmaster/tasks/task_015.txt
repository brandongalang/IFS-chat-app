# Title: Build Chat UI: Parts Sidebar Component
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the sidebar component that lists the user's emerged and acknowledged parts in real-time.
# Details:
Create a `PartsSidebar` React component that fetches and displays a list of parts for the current user. It should show the part's emoji, name, role, and confidence score. The component must update in real-time as new parts emerge or existing parts are updated during a session.

# Test Strategy:
Develop the component in Storybook with mock part data. Write an integration test to ensure the sidebar fetches data correctly and updates when the underlying data changes (e.g., via a state management hook).
