# Session Log: Planning for Insights & Parts Garden

**Date:** 2025-08-28
**Participants:** Jules (AI Engineer), User (Product Owner)

## Objective

This document logs the key decisions and pivots made during the planning session for a new feature set, initially titled the "Insights Tab."

## Session Summary

The planning process was iterative and collaborative, evolving significantly from the initial request to the final, comprehensive vision.

### 1. Initial Request

- The initial request was to plan the implementation of an "Insights Tab."
- The core idea was to use an LLM to read user session data and generate 3 daily "insight cards" for the user to interact with (confirm/deny, rate, add context).

### 2. Deep Planning & Vision Expansion

Through a series of clarifying questions and brainstorming, the vision expanded significantly:

- **Data Strategy Focus:** The conversation quickly shifted from a single feature to a broader **user data and context strategy**. The goal became to create a system that continuously learns about the user and builds a rich, evolving profile.
- **"Semantic Overview":** The concept of a "semantic overview" was introducedâ€”a running, LLM-maintained summary of the user's internal world.
- **"Guided Check-ins":** A new feature for morning/evening check-ins was designed. This would serve as a low-friction way to gather structured data and offer users a path to deeper, focused chat sessions.
- **"Proactive Part Discovery":** A key decision was made that the system should not be passive. It should proactively analyze user text to infer the existence of new "parts" and present them to the user for confirmation via specialized insight cards.
- **"The Parts Garden":** The vision for a dedicated space for users to view, manage, and interact with their discovered parts was established. This would be the destination for the work done in the rest of the app.
- **"Part Refinement" & "Patient Persistence":** The system was designed to handle the evolution of parts (e.g., a single part splitting into two). It was also decided that the system should be "patient," logging denied suggestions and only re-presenting them later with new evidence.

### 3. The Pivot to "AI Scaffolding"

- The implementation phase began with an attempt to create the necessary database migrations.
- A technical blocker was encountered: applying database migrations required a `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` which was not available.
- **Key Decision:** Rather than abandoning the work, the project was pivoted to a **documentation-only** deliverable.
- The new goal became to build out the full application infrastructure (database, APIs, UI) but to **mock** all AI-driven content generation. This "AI Scaffolding" approach allows the entire application flow to be built and tested, with the real AI logic to be plugged in later.

### 4. Documentation Cleanup & Consolidation

- As part of the pivot, a decision was made to clean up the existing documentation.
- Obsolete files (`TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/README_DELTA.md`) were identified for deletion.
- The final plan was to consolidate all the planning and design work into a clear set of documents:
    - An updated `docs/PRD.md` to reflect the full feature set.
    - A new `docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` to provide the technical blueprint.
    - This `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` to provide historical context.

## Final Outcome

The planning session resulted in a comprehensive, multi-phase vision for a sophisticated IFS companion app. Due to technical constraints, the immediate deliverable was changed to a full set of planning and design documents, enabling future implementation.
