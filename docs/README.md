# Constellation Documentation

This directory contains all of the product, design, and engineering documentation for Constellation. It is organized into two primary sections:

## 1. `/vision`

This directory contains the **"North Star"** documentation. It describes the long-term product vision, strategic goals, and the ideal architecture we are working towards. It is derived from the original Product Strategy document and should be used as a guiding light for our development efforts.

## 2. `/current_state`

This directory contains the **"Map"** of our application. It provides a practical, human-readable description of how the system *actually works today*. This includes its current architecture, feature implementations, and data models. This section is intended to be a living document, updated as the codebase evolves, to help team members understand the current reality of the system.
