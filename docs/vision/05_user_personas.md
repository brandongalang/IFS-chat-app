# User Personas & Pain Points

## Primary Persona: The Busy Self-Aware Professional

### Demographics

- Age: 28-45
- Has done some therapy or self-work
- Familiar with the concept of "parts" (even if not IFS specifically)
- Values personal growth but struggles with consistency
- Tech-savvy, uses productivity and wellness apps

### Core Pain Points

#### 1. The Cognitive Bottleneck

**Pain:** "I know I have these patterns, but I can't hold all the complexity in my head at once."

- Forgets breakthroughs from therapy sessions
- Loses track of which part is activated when
- Can't see the forest for the trees in their psychological landscape

#### 2. The Availability Gap

**Pain:** "I want to do the work, but I don't always have time for deep exploration."

- Therapy is scheduled, life is continuous
- Insights come at inconvenient times (commute, work breaks)
- Full journaling sessions require 20-30 minutes they don't have

#### 3. The Blank Page Problem

**Pain:** "I open my journal/app and don't know where to start."

- Overwhelmed by infinite possibilities
- Unsure what's most important to explore
- Cognitive load of generating topics from scratch

#### 4. The Follow-Through Failure

**Pain:** "I have these realizations but never act on them."

- Identifies patterns but doesn't address them
- Says "I should explore this" but never does
- Accumulates psychological "debt" of unprocessed insights

### User States & Engagement Modes

Our layered engagement model directly addresses these varying states:

#### State 1: "Just Checking In" (Low Energy/Time)

- **Available:** 30 seconds - 2 minutes
- **Mental Load:** Low
- **Need:** Quick acknowledgment, minimal friction
- **Solution:** Inbox with confirm/deny reactions

#### State 2: "Something Resonates" (Medium Energy/Time)

- **Available:** 2-5 minutes
- **Mental Load:** Medium
- **Need:** Explore a bit without full commitment
- **Solution:** Async threads (future feature)

#### State 3: "Ready to Dive Deep" (High Energy/Time)

- **Available:** 10-30 minutes
- **Mental Load:** High capacity
- **Need:** Full exploration and integration
- **Solution:** Chat sessions with full context

## Secondary Personas

## How Our Architecture Serves These Personas

### Inbox → Chat Bridge

**Solves:** Blank page problem, availability gap

- AI generates observations proactively
- User doesn't need to create content from scratch
- Two-touch flow respects limited time/energy

### Future: Async Threads

**Solves:** Follow-through failure, availability gap

- Captures insights when they resonate
- Allows processing at user's pace
- Prevents accumulation of "psychological debt"

### Intentional Constraints

**Solves:** Cognitive bottleneck

- Limited slots prevent overwhelm
- Forces prioritization of what matters most
- Makes patterns visible through what gets shelved

## Success Metrics by Persona

## Design Principles from Persona Insights

1. **Respect Cognitive Bandwidth**
   - Never require more than user can give
   - Make every interaction valuable at its depth level
   - Progressive engagement, not all-or-nothing

2. **Acknowledge Ambivalence**
   - Users want growth AND comfort
   - They identify patterns AND avoid them
   - Design for both impulses

3. **Create Gentle Accountability**
   - Surface patterns without judgment
   - Use constraints as therapeutic feedback
   - "Shelving" not "failing"

4. **Enable Distributed Practice**
   - Therapy happens in sessions, life happens continuously
   - Allow micro-engagements throughout the day
   - Maintain context across time and modes

## The Core Insight

Our users aren't failing at self-work—they're struggling with a tools problem. They need:

- **Less cognitive load**, not more features
- **Flexible engagement**, not rigid sessions
- **Persistent memory**, not episodic interactions
- **Gentle structure**, not infinite freedom

The layered engagement model (Inbox → Threads → Chat) directly maps to these varying states of availability and readiness, meeting users where they are rather than where we wish they were.
