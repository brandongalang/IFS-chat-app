## What
Visual exploration interface for browsing and drilling into Parts.

## Why
Offers a spatial/visual way to understand internal parts and relationships.

## How it works
- Detail at app/garden/[partId]/page.tsx (server)
  - Reads narrative content from the System 2 memory repository (`lib/memory/parts-repository`): sections like Role & Purpose, Current State, Origin
  - Supports YAML frontmatter format with emoji and metadata
  - Reads DB-backed fields (visualization, relationships, notes) via `@/lib/data/parts-server`
- The `parts-repository` uses a storage adapter to list and read markdown files. The Supabase storage adapter performs a recursive file listing to support the nested directory structure of part profiles.
- PartActions server actions import from `@/lib/data/parts-server` and update DB attributes (e.g., name/emoji via visualization)
- Part tool invocations route through tightened Zod schemas and an injected Supabase client, preventing untrusted payloads from mutating data

## Data model
- Dual storage model:
  - Markdown repository for narrative content (sections) and optional emoji in frontmatter
  - Database tables/views for identity, visualization, relationships, and notes

## Configuration
- Enabled by default via `config/features.ts`. Environments that need to hide the Garden must set `ENABLE_GARDEN` to a falsey value (`false`, `0`, or `off`). The feature flag is read during build, with optional support for mirroring via `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_GARDEN` when client overrides are required.

## Testing
- Unit tests for helper logic; Playwright for navigation (overview â†’ detail)

## Operational notes
- Confirm flag defaults and access control for non-authenticated users
