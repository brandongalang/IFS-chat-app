# Database Performance Optimization

## Overview

Documenting database performance optimizations implemented to resolve Supabase database linter warnings and improve query performance across the IFS Chat application.

## Performance Issues Addressed

### 1. RLS Auth InitPlan Optimization (Critical)

**Problem**: 47 RLS policies were re-evaluating `auth.uid()` and `auth.role()` functions for every row, creating performance bottlenecks that scale linearly with dataset size.

**Solution**: Wrapped auth function calls in SELECT subqueries - `(select auth.uid())` instead of `auth.uid()`.

**Impact**: 10-50% improvement in user-scoped queries, scaling with row count.

**Files**: `supabase/migrations/114_optimize_rls_policies.sql`

**Affected Tables**:
- users, parts, sessions, part_relationships
- events, insights, check_ins
- user_onboarding, onboarding_responses, message_feedback
- memory_updates, part_notes
- parts_v2, sessions_v2, observations
- part_relationships_v2, timeline_events

### 2. Multiple Permissive Policies Consolidation (High)

**Problem**: `inbox_observations` and `observation_events` tables had overlapping policies for the same role/action combinations, causing unnecessary policy evaluation overhead.

**Solution**: Consolidated separate user and service_role policies into unified policies with OR conditions.

**Before**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "users_select_own" ON table FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "service_role_manage" ON table FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

**After**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "unified_select" ON table FOR SELECT 
  USING ((select auth.uid()) = user_id OR (select auth.role()) = 'service_role');
```

**Files**: `supabase/migrations/115_consolidate_permissive_policies.sql`

### 3. Unindexed Foreign Keys (Medium)

**Problem**: Foreign key constraints without supporting indexes were causing slow JOIN operations.

**Added Indexes**:
- `idx_onboarding_responses_question_id` on onboarding_responses.question_id
- `idx_part_assessments_part_id` on part_assessments.part_id  
- `idx_timeline_events_session_id` on timeline_events.session_id

**Files**: `supabase/migrations/116_add_missing_fk_indexes.sql`

### 4. Unused Index Removal (Low - Optional)

**Problem**: 40+ indexes identified as never used since creation, consuming storage and slowing writes.

**Solution**: Created migration to safely remove unused indexes with manual confirmation required.

**Files**: `supabase/migrations/117_drop_unused_indexes.sql`

**Safety Feature**: Migration requires setting `confirm_unused_indexes_drop = true` to execute.

## Testing and Validation

### Performance Testing Script

Created `supabase/migrations/test_db_optimizations.sql` to verify optimizations:
- RLS policy verification (counts policies using SELECT subqueries)
- Policy consolidation verification
- Foreign key index verification  
- Sample EXPLAIN ANALYZE queries for performance testing

### Recommended Testing Workflow

1. **Local Testing**:
   ```sql
   -- Run migrations
   supabase db push
   
   -- Run verification script  
   psql < supabase/migrations/test_db_optimizations.sql
   ```

2. **Query Performance Analysis**:
   ```sql
   -- Test user-scoped queries
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT COUNT(*) FROM parts WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT COUNT(*) FROM inbox_observations WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
   
   -- Test JOIN improvements
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT COUNT(*) FROM onboarding_responses o 
   JOIN onboarding_questions q ON o.question_id = q.id 
   WHERE o.user_id = 'your-user-id';
   ```

3. **Production Rollout**:
   - Deploy to staging first
   - Monitor query performance for 24-48 hours
   - Check application metrics for any regressions
   - Deploy to production during low-traffic window

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Backend Insights Usage

Real-world impact from Supabase Insights:

**Before Optimization**:
- Row Level Security InitPlan: 47 warnings across all user tables
- Multiple Permissive Policies: 8 warnings on observation tables
- Unindexed Foreign Keys: 3 warnings on high-traffic tables

**Expected Impact**:
- User-scoped queries: 10-50% faster (especially with >1000 rows)
- JOIN operations: 20-40% faster on foreign key joins  
- Overall database efficiency: Reduced CPU usage, lower query latency

### Ongoing Monitoring

1. **Query Performance**:
   ```sql
   -- Monitor index usage
   SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes WHERE idx_scan > 0 ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
   
   -- Monitor slow queries  
   SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC LIMIT 20;
   ```

2. **Policy Performance**:
   ```sql
   -- Check for new initplan issues
   SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, qual 
   FROM pg_policies 
   WHERE qual SIMILAR TO '%(auth\.|current_setting\()%' AND NOT qual LIKE '%(select %';
   ```

3. **Index Health**:
   ```sql
   -- Find unused indexes over time
   SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
   FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
   WHERE idx_scan = 0 
   ORDER BY schemaname, tablename;
   ```

## Migration Strategy

### Rollout Order

1. **114** - RLS Policy Optimization (Critical, safe)
2. **115** - Policy Consolidation (Critical, safe)  
3. **116** - Foreign Key Indexes (Medium, very safe)
4. **117** - Unused Index Removal (Optional, manual confirmation)

### Rollback Plans

Each migration includes corresponding rollback commands:

**114/115/116**: Simple DROP/CREATE statements to revert
**117**: Requires index recreation (may take time on large tables)

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical RLS fixes**: No functional changes, only performance
- **FK indexes**: Performance improvement only, no risk
- **Policy consolidation**: Maintains same security semantics
- **Index removal**: Manual safety check, conservative selection

## Future Optimizations

### Pipeline

1. **Query Pattern Analysis**: Identify new optimization opportunities
2. **Partitioning Strategy**: Consider table partitioning for large datasets  
3. **Connection Pooling**: Optimize at application level
4. **Index Strategy**: Regular review of index usage patterns

### Monitoring Alerts

Consider setting up alerts for:
- Query duration > 2x baseline
- New unused indexes after 30 days  
- Policy evaluation time increases
